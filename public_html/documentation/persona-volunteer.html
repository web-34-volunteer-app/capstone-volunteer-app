  <h1>Persona: Volunteer/Seeker</h1>
  <h2>Name:</h2>
  <p>John Filer</p>
  <h2>Profession:</h2>
  <p>
    John is a first-class petty officer in the navy. It is strongly encouraged, in order to be competitive for the next rank, to perform extra-curricular activities and participate in the community.
  </p>
  <h2>Technology: </h2>
  <p>
    John is an average PC user with a smart phone. He uses his computer mostly for administrative functions, such as e-mail or news, and leverages his devices for connecting with friends and family.
  </p>
  <h2>Attitudes and Behaviors: </h2>
  <p>
    John is outwardly friendly, and ambitious. He has a singular focus and, in an attempt to be successful in his career, accumulates as many collateral duties at work, volunteer hours, and educational credits as possible.
  </p>
  <h2>Frustration: </h2>
  <p>
    John has some extra time during the week to volunteer, but is finding it difficult to find great volunteer opportunities that fold nicely into his schedule.
  </p>
  <h2>Goal:</h2>
  <p>
    John wants a one-stop location to find all the volunteer opportunities he can so that he can engineer his schedule for success.
  </p>
  <h2>User Story:</h2>
  <p>
    As a U.S. Sailor, I discover more volunteer opportunities than I know what to do with. I am able to pick and choose the ones I think would be enjoyable and look the best on my eval.
<!--    It may be time to start thinking bigger and pull other people from work into the fold.-->
