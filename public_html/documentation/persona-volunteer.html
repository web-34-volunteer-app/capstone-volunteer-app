  <h1>Persona: Volunteer/Seeker</h1>
  <h2>Name:</h2>
  <p>John Filer</p>
  <h2>Profession:</h2>
  <p>
    John is a first-class petty officer in the navy. It is strongly encouraged, in order to be competitive for the next rank, to perform extra-curricular activities and participate in the community.
  </p>
  <h2>Technology: </h2>
  <p>
    John is an average PC user with a smart phone. He uses his computer mostly for administrative functions, such as e-mail or news, and leverages his devices for connecting with friends and family.
  </p>
  <h2>Attitudes and Behaviors: </h2>
  <p>
    John is outwardly friendly, and ambitious. He has a singular focus and, in an attempt to be successful in his career, accumulates as many collateral duties at work, volunteer hours, and educational credits as possible.
  </p>
  <h2>Frustration: </h2>
  <p>
    John has some extra time during the week to volunteer, but is finding it difficult to find great volunteer opportunities that fold nicely into his schedule.
  </p>
  <h2>Goal:</h2>
  <p>
    John wants a one-stop location to find all the volunteer opportunities he can so that he can engineer his schedule for success.

  <h2>User Story:</h2>
  <p>As a normal user of Mission Citizen, I would like to visit the website, search for new volunteer events, stay up to date with saved volunteer events, contact event organizers and other volunteers, change my privacy settings to allow other users to contact me, and get a report of my volunteering history.</p>
  <h2>Interaction Flow:</h2>
  <p><span class="name">User: </span>Navigates to the website home page on his smart phone.</p>
  <p><span class="name">System: </span>Since he regularly visits the website from this device, the system maintains his login. His username is displayed in the navigation bar to indicate he is still logged in. The welcome banner is displayed below the navigation bar; just below that is a list of hyperlinks describing upcoming dates of volunteer events, event names, and contact lists for the event.</p>
  <p><span class="name">User: </span>He clicks on the top event name, which is the soonest to occur.</p>
  <p><span class="name">System: </span>A new page appears (either replacing whole page or a frame of the home page), displaying the event name, date, point of contact (POC), details, address, and a list of other available contacts. There is a checkbox to control privacy and allow other volunteers involved with this event to contact John. There is a green light indication in the top left indicating that John is registered to attend this event. There are buttons at the bottom of the form to unregister from the event, contact the POC, or flag suspicious activity.</p>
  <p><span class="name">User: </span>He clicks the "Return (or Home)" link.</p>
  <p><span class="name">System: </span>The home page reappears.</p>

  <p><span class="name">System: </span>The interactive map displayed below the search filter zooms to enlarge his zip code region and is populated with pins of different colors, indicating different classifications of events. Mousing over pins will display the event name, date, and a brief description. Below (Or perhaps to the left, like google map directions) the map is a table of all the events queried, along with dates, event names, address, point of contact, etc.</p>
  <p><span class="name">User: </span>He clicks the name of an event that falls on a date he needs to fill.</p>
  <p><span class="name">System: </span>The event page is again displayed. The green light indication is red, indicating that John is not registered for this event. The "Unregister" button instead says "Register".</p>
  <p><span class="name">User: </span>He clicks the "Register" button.</p>
  <p><span class="name">System: </span>A pop-up window indicates "You are registered for this event." The "Register" button reverts to "Unregister" and the red light/text indicator becomes green, indicating he is registered for the event.</p>
