    <h1>Persona: New User/Visitor</h1>
    <h2>Name:</h2>
    <p>Kendra Foxx</p>
    <h2>Profession:</h2>
    <p>
        Kendra is a part-time undergrad student working toward a degree in social science. She lives at home while attending school and has extra time on her hand due to not having to work and only attending school part-time. She feels like volunteering could help get her some useful experience and learn more about social interactions to provide significant insights into her studies.
    </p>
    <h2>Technology: </h2>
    <p>
        Kendra is on a budget and only has a consumer-level PC laptop for her studies. She has an iPhone to communicate with her friends who moved away and check social media. She is more of a moderate technology user and is very practical in her technology use.
    </p>
    <h2>Attitudes and Behaviors: </h2>
    <p>
        Kendra wants her journey in self-growth and education to be broad to have more to offer the world. She is open to doing as much as possible if she is learning and able to help others.
    </p>
    <h2>Frustration: </h2>
    <p>
        Kendra wants to volunteer but is limited in her ability to travel due to not having a car and relying on public transportation. She may need a ride from time to time to get to volunteer locations.
    </p>
    <h2>Goal:</h2>
    <p>
        Kendra finds a volunteer opportunity valuable to her education and personal goals. There is plenty of opportunity within walking distance of her home; for those opportunities not close enough to walk, there’s also a possibility for people offering ride-share.
    </p>
    <h2>User Story:</h2>
    <p>
        As a potential volunteer, I discover an opportunity that is perfect for me. All obstacles are removed for me to participate; I decide to register to volunteer and get more information.
