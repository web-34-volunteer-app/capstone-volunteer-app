    <h1>Persona: Volunteer Opportunity Creator</h1>
    <h2>Name:</h2>
    <p>Christina Jimenez</p>
    <h2>Profession:</h2>
    <p>
        Volunteer manager at Paving Paths, a nonprofit focused on mentorship and bridging gaps in education for at risk
        youth. She also serves on the board of Nonprofits New Mexico. Christina’s organization relies on volunteers to
        provide various services. Due to COVID restrictions, they were unable to have in-person volunteers. However, as
        restrictions are being lifted, Christina is tasked with promoting and recruiting volunteers. She is looking for
        a website where she can share upcoming volunteer opportunities with her community.
    </p>
    <h2>Technology: </h2>
    <p>
        13.3” MacBook Pro (macOS Catalina, version 10.15.7 operating system), iPhone X 4G speed unlimited data (iOS 14.1
        operating system). As a practiced user of technology, Christina possesses intermediate computer skills. She is
        comfortable installing programs, navigating websites, and completing daily tasks such as viewing emails, using
        her calendar and checking social media websites.
    </p>
    <h2>Attitudes and Behaviors: </h2>
    <p>
        Christina is an extrovert and loves attending community events. She is an avid net-worker and thrives in finding
        opportunities to create new relationships. She believes everyone can make a difference. She prefers getting to
        know people personally rather than just as a business opportunity. She wants to make the most out of her
        connections to grow her organization and raise awareness for topics that matter to her the most. Christina
        favors websites that effectively meet her needs and are visually informative. She enjoys recruiting, training
        and managing volunteers.
    </p>
    <h2>Frustration: </h2>
    <p>
        Christina is frustrated by rude and thoughtless individuals. She is often in a crunch for time as she manages
        several positions. She dislikes excessive reliance on social media and poor communication. Christina is looking
        for passionate, dependable, competent and trustworthy individuals to volunteer at her organization.
    </p>
    <h2>Goal:</h2>
    <p>
        To share volunteer opportunities with her community and leverage their skills to foster education and mentorship
        amongst youth.
    </p>
    <h2>User Story:</h2>
    <p>
        As a user, I need to have a platform where I can share opportunities to increase volunteers who can help fulfill
        our mission.
